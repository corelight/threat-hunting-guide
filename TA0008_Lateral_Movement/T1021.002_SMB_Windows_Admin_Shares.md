### SMB/Windows Admin Shares [\[T1021.002\]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002/)

Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative functions. Example network shares include `C$`, `ADMIN$`, and `IPC$`.

Attackers often use SMB to connect to administrative shares on Microsoft Windows workstations and servers. They may want to learn more about the target, extract sensitive files, upload malicious payloads, or authenticate so that further tools and attacks can proceed. Corelight monitors SMB traffic, including authentication attempts, allowing defenders to log and notice patterns of administrative authentication attempts as well as monitor SMB traffic to extract transferred files. The following example demonstrates the action `FILE_OPEN` being performed using the hidden admin share, and includes MAC information. Corelight logs the action performed including Open/Rename/Delete/Write.
