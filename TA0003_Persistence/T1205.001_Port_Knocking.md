### Port Knocking [\[T1205.001\]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

Port knocking is a technique to get a remote system to enable access to an otherwise closed port. It typically consists of a pre-defined sequence of connections to other (often closed) ports, sometimes with special protocol-level flags, Layer 7 banner strings, etc.

Zeek summarizes each TCP, UDP, and ICMP connection in the `conn` log. This detailed log provides useful statistics about connections. The `history`, `conn_state`, and `id` tuple (orig/resp IP/port) fields provide the information necessary to sight port knocking. It is important to note that sighting port knocking without an additional hint can be a daunting task, as it is easy to hide intentional sequences of connections among the noise of a typical network.
